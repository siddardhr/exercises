IP, MAC, NAT, and Networking Basics

This file contains notes on networking topics including IP addressing, MAC addresses, NAT, network interfaces, port numbers, and related concepts. Updated daily with new learnings.

1. IP Addresses
1.1 What is an IP Address?

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address) is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected to a network.

Types:

IPv4: 32-bit address, e.g., 192.168.1.1

IPv6: 128-bit address, e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

1.2 Private vs Public IP

Private IP: Used within private networks. Not routable on the Internet.

Ranges (IPv4):

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255

172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255

192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255

Public IP: Routable on the Internet. Assigned by ISP.

1.3 Subnetting (Basics)

Divides IP ranges into sub-networks.

Example:

192.168.1.0/24 → 256 IPs (0–255)

/24 indicates subnet mask 255.255.255.0

2. MAC Addresses

MAC Address (Media Access Control) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces.

Format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX (hexadecimal)

Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

MAC addresses operate at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) in the OSI model.

3. NAT (Network Address Translation)
3.1 What is NAT?

NAT translates private IP addresses to public IP addresses so devices inside a private network can access the Internet.

3.2 Types of NAT

Static NAT: One-to-one mapping between private and public IP.

Dynamic NAT: Maps private IPs to public IPs dynamically from a pool.

PAT (Port Address Translation / NAT Overload): Many private IPs share one public IP using different ports.

3.3 NAT Table Conversion Example
Private IP	Public IP	Port
192.168.1.10	203.0.113.5	5000
192.168.1.11	203.0.113.5	5001
4. Network Interfaces

Network interfaces connect a device to a network.

Common types:

Ethernet (wired) → eth0, enp3s0

Wi-Fi (wireless) → wlan0, wlp2s0

Loopback → lo (127.0.0.1)

4.1 Checking Interfaces (Linux Example)
ip addr show

5. Port Numbers and Programs

Ports allow multiple applications to use network connections on a single device.

Well-known ports (0–1023): System services

HTTP → 80

HTTPS → 443

SSH → 22

DNS → 53

Registered ports (1024–49151): Applications

Dynamic/Private ports (49152–65535): Temporary connections

5.1 Relation to Programs

A server program listens on a specific port.

A client connects to the server IP + port combination.
