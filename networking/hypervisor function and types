Virtualization Concepts: Hypervisors, VMs, VBS

This file contains notes on virtualization technologies including hypervisors, types, functions, virtual machines (VMs), and Virtualization-Based Security (VBS). Updated daily with new learnings.

1. What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of a resource, such as a server, desktop, storage device, or network.

Benefits:

Efficient resource usage

Isolation between applications/OS

Easy deployment and testing

Security enhancements

2. Hypervisors
2.1 Definition

A hypervisor is software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).

It sits between the physical hardware and the virtual machines.

2.2 Types of Hypervisors
Type	Name / Example	Description
Type 1 (Bare-metal)	VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen	Runs directly on hardware. No host OS needed. High performance.
Type 2 (Hosted)	VMware Workstation, VirtualBox	Runs on a host OS. Easier to use but slightly less efficient.
2.3 Functions of Hypervisors

Allocate CPU, memory, storage, and network to VMs

Isolate VMs from each other

Enable live migration of VMs

Snapshot and restore VMs

Monitor and manage VM performance

3. Virtual Machines (VMs)

VM is a software-based emulation of a physical computer.

Components of a VM:

Virtual CPU (vCPU)

Virtual memory (vRAM)

Virtual storage (vDisk)

Virtual network interface card (vNIC)

Advantages:

Multiple OS instances on one physical machine

Testing, development, and sandbox environments

Resource optimization

3.1 VM Lifecycle

Creation

Configuration (CPU, RAM, storage)

Running / Pausing

Snapshot / Restore

Deletion

4. Virtualization-Based Security (VBS)

VBS uses hardware virtualization features to create an isolated memory region for security features.

Provides:

Credential Guard: Protects sensitive account credentials

Hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI)

Secure Kernel Mode

Requirements: CPU with virtualization support (Intel VT-x or AMD-V) and Hypervisor support.

5. Virtualization Examples / Tools

VMware → vSphere, Workstation

Microsoft Hyper-V → Hyper-V Manager, PowerShell commands

Oracle VirtualBox → Desktop virtualization

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) → Linux virtualization
